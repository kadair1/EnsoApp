    "imagePrompt": "Design a cover image that perfectly captures the essence of our event at the Cool SoMa Gallery. Combine the relaxed and classy mood that you're feeling with the undefined mood of the venue to create a visually stunning image.\n\nImagine a sleek black and white photograph of the gallery's entrance, with its modern glass doors and chic signage. The lighting is soft and inviting, creating an atmosphere of tranquility and elegance. As you walk through the doors, you're greeted by the sight of beautiful artwork adorning the walls, adding a touch of sophistication to the space.\n\nIn the foreground, place a comfortable lounge chair, draped with a luxurious cashmere throw blanket. The chair is positioned next to a small side table, adorned with a crystal glass filled with a refreshing drink. This arrangement symbolizes the relaxed atmosphere of the event, inviting guests to unwind and enjoy the evening.\n\nTo add a touch of class, incorporate a subtle element of glamour into the image. Perhaps a chandelier hangs from the ceiling, casting a soft glow over the gallery, or a mirror reflects the artwork, creating an illusion of depth and sophistication.\n\nFinally, overlay the image with elegant typography that showcases the event details, using a combination of modern and classic fonts. The colors should be muted, with shades of charcoal and silver, to maintain the refined and relaxed mood.\n\nBy combining the relaxed and classy mood you're feeling with the undefined mood of the Cool SoMa Gallery, this cover image will capture the essence of the event and entice guests to join us for an evening of sophistication and relaxation.",

The gathering will have approximately 80 attendees, and we would require the venue for around 6 hours.\n\nAdditionally, I would like to confirm if outside food is permissible at the venue, as we are planning to work with Fork & Spoon, a catering service that specializes in sushi, cheese, and charcuterie boards. They align perfectly with the relaxed and classy mood of our event.\n\nPlease let me know if the Cool SoMa Gallery is available on the specified date, and if outside food is allowed.
